# Web_scrapping
Through this experience, I've acquired the essential skills for executing comprehensive web-scraping and data analysis projects. I can now proficiently navigate HTML structures, identify elements by their attributes like id and class, and extract targeted information using tools such as Splinter for automated browsing and Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing. This includes scraping diverse data types such as HTML tables and multiple instances of recurring elements like news articles. These skills not only enhance my ability to collect and organize data effectively but also enable me to analyze findings thoroughly and communicate insights visually.
